## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality, I write unit tests that check for both typical and edge case behavior. I validate inputs, handle exceptions properly, and follow best practices for clean and maintainable code. To improve security, I avoid hardcoding sensitive data, validate all user input, and structure the code to prevent common vulnerabilities like null pointer exceptions or injection risks.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by reviewing project requirements and imagining how an end-user might interact with the program. I also consider usability, ensuring that the program is easy to understand and use. During development, I continuously refer back to user stories or requirements to guide decisions and make sure that each feature provides real value to the user.

### How do I approach designing software?

I start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. I identify key classes, their responsibilities, and how they will interact. I use diagrams or notes to plan the structure, then gradually build and test each component. I also try to follow design principles like separation of concerns and modularity so the code is easier to maintain and scale later on.
